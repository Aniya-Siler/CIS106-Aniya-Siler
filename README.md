## Assignment 1
This coding class is required in my field of study which is Web Design. I have taken coding classes before but I was not a fan, but after reading how the class is structure I started to get excited. I appreciated learning things holistically and it seem that is how I will be learning in this class. This will give me a better idea if I want to be more on the frontend or backend of web design. I look forward to learning more and being challenged in this world of coding.

## Assignment 2
The programming language that I selected was Python and I will use Thonny as the integrated development environment. I chose this language because I found that it was the most beginner-friendly programming language, and it would allow me to get the most out of this class without being heavily confused and overwhelmed. I also chose Python because Twitter uses Python, and I found this really interesting. I intend on using this language in order to build a website for my small business(handmade soy wax candles), and I am also going to apply it to my future career in web design/web development.
