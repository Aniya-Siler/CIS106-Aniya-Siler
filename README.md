## Assignment 1
This coding class is required in my field of study which is Web Design. I have taken coding classes before but I was not a fan, but after reading how the class is structure I started to get excited. I appreciated learning things holistically and it seem that is how I will be learning in this class. This will give me a better idea if I want to be more on the frontend or backend of web design. I look forward to learning more and being challenged in this world of coding.

## Assignment 2
The programming language that I selected was Python and I will use Thonny as the integrated development environment. I chose this language because I found that it was the most beginner-friendly programming language, and it would allow me to get the most out of this class without being heavily confused and overwhelmed. I also chose Python because Twitter uses Python, and I found this really interesting. I intend on using this language in order to build a website for my small business(handmade soy wax candles), and I am also going to apply it to my future career in web design/web development.

## Assignment 3
I learned a lot throughout this session. I learned how to problem solve, apply what I learned, and Plan, and with all that I learned, I created a program. The program that I created is able to convert Miles into yards, feet, and inches. I can apply this to my world by making different types of programs that I may use, for instance, I noticed one of the program activities was an age calculator. I often search for my exact age on google, it would be so much more rewarding if I could just use my own program that I created.

## Assignment 4
During this programming session, I learned how to use the resources given to me and apply them. It was difficult for me at first to understand the assignment but once I understood it, It was quite simple. The Programming Fundamentals book “Data and Operators” and specifically the section, on Python examples really helped me. I would use what I learned in the section in the future to backtrack and really understand the material. I would also use this in the future to help my classmates when in need and apply it to other things that I want to/ have to program.

## Assignment 5
Our assignment for session 5 covered a number of topics, including parameters, functions, return variables, and so on. It took me a little while to get used to the vocabulary words and all these unfamiliar terms that were being used in the Programming Fundamentals book. I am the type of learner who learns as I proceed, and as I progressed in the assignment I started understanding. When I saw everything right in front of me, it really helped me to make sense of it all. As a result of my experience, I will be able to use what I have learned in the future for assignments, my career, and my college career.

## Assignment 6
In this session number 6, we learned how to apply what we learned previously, which was functions, and write code without flowgirthim. I love how this lesson plan is teaching and guiding us to understand the fundamentals of coding. Even though this class is a little fast paced it’s really easy when you understand and take your time. As I learned to code, I ran into a lot of issues. What I learned was to go line by line, no more than 3 at a time. This helped to analyze the code and figure out which line specifically has an error.
## Assignment 7
We read about conditions in session 7, how they are defined, and what the different subcategories within them are. We learned about Structured Programming, Selection Control Structures, If Then Else, Code Blocks, Relational Operators, Assignment vs Equality, Logical Operators, Nested If Then Else, and Case Control Structures, which all fall under the subcategory of Conditions. As a result of reading the article, I assumed that I understood the different operator keys when it came to Relational Operators and Logical Operators. It is possible to measure by greater, lesser, equal, as well as other measures. Additionally, I learned how to create a flowchart (part of the assignment) which included the use of the If then else construct. The overall purpose of this lesson is to teach me how to add choices to my program in order to make it more flexible and how to express them in my flowchart and code.

## Assignment 8
