## Assignment 1
This coding class is required in my field of study which is Web Design. I have taken coding classes before but I was not a fan, but after reading how the class is structure I started to get excited. I appreciated learning things holistically and it seem that is how I will be learning in this class. This will give me a better idea if I want to be more on the frontend or backend of web design. I look forward to learning more and being challenged in this world of coding.

## Assignment 2
The programming language that I selected was Python and I will use Thonny as the integrated development environment. I chose this language because I found that it was the most beginner-friendly programming language, and it would allow me to get the most out of this class without being heavily confused and overwhelmed. I also chose Python because Twitter uses Python, and I found this really interesting. I intend on using this language in order to build a website for my small business(handmade soy wax candles), and I am also going to apply it to my future career in web design/web development.

## Assignment 3
I learned a lot throughout this session. I learned how to problem solve, apply what I learned, and Plan, and with all that I learned, I created a program. The program that I created is able to convert Miles into yards, feet, and inches. I can apply this to my world by making different types of programs that I may use, for instance, I noticed one of the program activities was an age calculator. I often search for my exact age on google, it would be so much more rewarding if I could just use my own program that I created.
